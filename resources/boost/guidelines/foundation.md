# Package Boost Guidelines

These guidelines replace Laravel Boost's default foundation for
repositories that ship as Composer packages — Laravel-targeted or
framework-agnostic. The framing, tooling, and trade-offs differ from
application development; follow this version when working inside a
package codebase.

## Foundational Context

This codebase is a **Composer package**, not an application. The rules
below hold regardless of which framework (if any) the package targets.

- There is no `app/`, `bootstrap/`, `routes/`, `.env`, or database by
  default. Tooling that assumes an application context (e.g. running
  `php artisan` against the package itself) does not apply.
- The primary artefact is the package's public API — entry-point
  classes, service providers, exposed contracts. Everything else is
  scaffolding.
- Downstream consumers depend on this package via Composer. Every
  public change is a user-facing API change governed by semver.
- `composer.json` is the source of truth for supported PHP versions
  and any framework constraints. Check `require.php` (and any
  `require.<framework>/*` entries) before using version-specific
  features.

## Source Layout

- `src/` — package source, PSR-4 autoloaded per `composer.json`
- `tests/` — Pest or PHPUnit suite
- `config/` — publishable defaults shipped with the package, when
  applicable
- `resources/` — views, translations, Boost skills / guidelines, when
  applicable
- `database/migrations`, `database/factories` — only if the package
  ships them
- `workbench/` — developer-only Testbench scaffolding when Testbench
  is in use; never shipped

Check sibling files before inventing structure. Do not introduce new
top-level directories without a clear reason.

## Tests Are the Specification

The package has no running application to click through. Tests are how
behaviour is pinned down.

- Write tests alongside any behavioural change.
- Do not create "verification scripts" when a test can prove the same
  thing.
- Run the project's configured test runner (`vendor/bin/pest` or
  `vendor/bin/phpunit`) before claiming a change is done.

## Public API Discipline

- Every `public`, `protected`, or exported symbol is part of the
  package's surface. Breaking changes require a major version bump.
- Prefer `final` classes and `private`/`@internal` markers for
  anything not intended for extension.
- Keep config keys, published asset paths, and service container
  bindings stable across patch and minor versions.

## Conventions

- Match existing code style, naming, and structural patterns — check
  sibling files before writing new ones.
- Use descriptive names (`resolvePublishDestination`, not `resolve()`).
- Reuse existing helpers before adding new ones.
- Do not add dependencies without approval; every new `require` is a
  constraint downstream consumers inherit.

## Documentation Files

Only create or edit documentation (README, CHANGELOG, docs/) when
explicitly requested or when a behaviour change requires it.

## Replies

Be concise. Focus on what changed and why. Skip restating what the
diff already shows.
