 * Wraps a plain Symfony Command so it satisfies Composer's CommandProvider
 * capability, which runtime-checks `instanceof Composer\Command\BaseCommand`
 * and rejects anything else.
 *
 * Vendored from boost-core, which shipped this adapter through 0.5.x and
 * removed it in 0.6.0 when it dropped its own Composer plugin.
 * package-boost-php is still a `composer-plugin`, so it still needs it.
 *
 * This file is only autoloaded when something references it — which only
 * happens via `PackageBoostPhpCommandProvider::getCommands()` inside an
 * actual Composer plugin invocation, where `Composer\Command\BaseCommand`
 * is always present. The standalone `vendor/bin/boost` path never touches
 * the provider or this adapter, so end-user installs without
 * `composer/composer` in vendor/ stay safe.
